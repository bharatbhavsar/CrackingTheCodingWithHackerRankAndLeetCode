/**
 * Problem Statement:

	A jail has N prisoners, and each prisoner has a unique id number, S, 
	ranging from 1 to N. There are M sweets that must be distributed to the prisoners.
	
	The jailer decides the fairest way to do this is by sitting the prisoners down in a circle 
	(ordered by ascending S), and then, starting with some random S, distribute one candy at a 
	time to each sequentially numbered prisoner until all M candies are distributed. 
	For example, if the jailer picks prisoner S = 2, then his distribution order would be 
	(2, 3, 4, 5,..., n-1, n, 1, 2, 3, 4,...) until all M sweets are distributed.
	
	But wait�there's a catch�the very last sweet is poisoned! Can you find and print the ID number 
	of the last prisoner to receive a sweet so he can be warned?
	
	Input Format:
	
	The first line contains an integer, T, denoting the number of test cases. 
	The T subsequent lines each contain 3 space-separated integers: 
	N (the number of prisoners), M (the number of sweets), and S (the prisoner ID), 
	respectively.
	
	Output Format:
	
	For each test case, print the ID number of the prisoner who receives the poisoned sweet on a 
	new line.
