/**
 * John Watson performs an operation called a right circular rotation on an array of integers, .
 *  After performing one right circular rotation operation, the array is transformed from  to .

Watson performs this operation k times. To test Sherlock's ability to identify the current 
element at a particular position in the rotated array, Watson asks q queries, where each query 
consists of a single integer, m, for which you must print the element at index m in the rotated 
array (i.e., the value of a[m]).

Input Format

The first line contains  3 space-separated integers, n, k,  and q, respectively. 
The second line contains  n space-separated integers, where each integer i describes 
array element a[i] (where 0 <= i < n ). 
Each of the  subsequent lines contains a single integer denoting .

Constraints

Output Format

For each query, print the value of the element at index  of the rotated array on a new line.
